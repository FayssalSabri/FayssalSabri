# Hi there üëã, I'm Fayssal Sabri

üîç Driven by curiosity, shaped by data.

## About me
I am Fayssal Sabri, a final-year dual degree student in Industrial Engineering and Data Science at ENSAM Mekn√®s and Centrale Lyon. My passion lies at the crossroads of engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence.

My journey started in industrial engineering, where I gained a solid foundation in complex systems and optimization. Alongside, I have cultivated a strong interest in AI and data-driven solutions, teaching myself advanced topics like computer vision and reinforcement learning.

Although my formal studies are rooted in engineering, I‚Äôm driven by curiosity to explore how AI can transform a wide range of challenges‚Äînot limited to any one sector. Looking ahead, I‚Äôm excited about contributing to innovative projects that leverage AI to solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact.
